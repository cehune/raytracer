•	Static C++ Raytracer accelerated through Surface Area Heuristic Bounding Volume Hierarchy

•	Uses super sampling anti-aliasing, naïve frustrum culling (in development), and light scattering algorithms

•	Handles spheres and triangle meshes loaded from 3 point and 4 point face object files, capable of moving said meshes anywhere via geometric transformations
